If you have questions about Date::Manip, refer to the Date::Manip pod file.
Don't know what I'm talking about?  Read the perlpod man page.  Alternately,
an online version of the Date::Manip man page is included in my home page

about Date::Manip to a newsgroup or emailing me.  If you've done this, I'll be
glad to answer any questions not covered or unclear in the man page.


** IMPORTANT NOTE (5.35) **

I am considering going OO... so everyone should use the appropriate
functions (UnixDate, Date_Cmp, Delta_Format) to extract information
from dates and deltas.  Any script which parses a date or delta as
a string will stop working when/if I make this change.  Even if I
don't, the internal format for both will change, so the above routines
should be used.

Also, the Date_DaysSince999 routine is deprecated (replace by
Date_DaysSince1BC) and will be removed in one of the next releases.


Notes for version 5.35:
   Bug fixes and documentaion changes.
   Added Romanian, Italian; corrections to Swedish, German translation.
   Modified Date_GetPrev/Date_GetNext to take $curr=2.
   Added Apache log file format "dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss (time zone)".
   Added OS/2 support.
   Deprecated the function Date_DaysSince999. 
   Fixed support for years 0000-0999.
   Many changes to recurrences including:
      *** Flags are now supported
      Added test suite
      Added support for Easter
      Fixed a bug where base/date0/date1 not treated correctly
   Added some timezones.
   Improved holiday support considerably:
      *** Added support for recurrences and one-year-only holidays
      Fixed Veteren's day, added Good Friday (off by default)
   Added Date_IsHoliday routine.
   *** Added the PathSep config variable to improve support for non-Unix paths.
   *** Date_Init can now return a list of config variables if called in
      array context.


Backwards incompatibilities:

  Version 5.35
  Deprecated the function Date_DaysSince999.  It's been replaced by
    Date_DaysSince1BC.  It will disappear in the next version.
  *** Added the PathSep variable which may cause problems on WinXX platforms
    with old config files where a colon is assumed.

All documentation is now contained in the Manip.pod file so I don't have
to keep it up-to-date in two places.
