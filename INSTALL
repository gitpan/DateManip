Before you install Date::Manip, check out the variables at the top of
Date/Manip.pm.  If you are not in the United States, you may wish to
change the default language (DefLang) or whether 01/02 means Jan 2 or
Feb 1 (DefDateFormat).  Also, check to make sure that Date::Manip can
correctly determine the time zone or set the TZ variable.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

To install, just type
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


MANUAL INSTALLATION

Some people have reported problems with the automatic installation above.
If the above fails, installing manually is very simple.  Just do the
following:

Take a look at the value of @INC in a perl script (run the debugger and
print @INC).  In any of the directories that it lists, create a directory
named Date.  Copy Date/Manip.pm to this directory.

In our installation, I have installed DateManip as:
        /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Date/Manip.pm

Make sure that in your perl script you have the line:
        use Date::Manip;


You can also create the man page using the command:
        pod2man Manip.pm > Date::Manip.3
and install it somewhere in your MANPATH.  I have it in:
        /usr/local/man/man3/Date::Manip.3


To test it, cd to the "t" directory and run the "runtests" command.


TESTS

If any of the tests fail... don't panic.  This is the first release with a
test suite, and the tests themselves may have bugs in them.  Some of them
may run correctly only in the EST timezone for example.  Some will fail if
they are run on a very slow computer (it will compare two different times
that were supposed to be the same but aren't because a measurable amount of
time passed between determining the time in two different ways).  I will
try to get any bugs out of the test suite quickly.

There are a few things which will almost always cause problems.  If you
modify any of the default options in Manip.pm before running tests, some
tests will probably fail.  Also, if you modify the DateManip.cnf file,
tests may fail.  To get around this, you should probably run the following
sequence of commands using an UNMODIFIED version of Date::Manip.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

If all the tests pass, you're fine, so proceed with the installation.  Modify
any defaults in Manip.pm you want and then type:

   make
   make install

So, you build Date::Manip twice.  Once using an unmodified version which is
used only to run the tests and a second time using any local modifications
which you will then install.
