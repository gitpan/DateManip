Before you install Date::Manip, check out the variables at the top of
Date/Manip.pm.  If you are not in the United States, you may wish to
change the default language (DefLang) or whether 01/02 means Jan 2 or
Feb 1 (DefDateFormat).  Also, check to make sure that Date::Manip can
correctly determine the time zone or set the TZ variable.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

To install, just type
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


MANUAL INSTALLATION

Some people have reported problems with the automatic installation above.
If the above fails, installing manually is very simple.  Just do the
following:

Take a look at the value of @INC in a perl script (run the debugger and
print @INC).  In any of the directories that it lists, create a directory
named Date.  Copy Date/Manip.pm to this directory.

In our installation, I have installed DateManip as:
        /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Date/Manip.pm

Make sure that in your perl script you have the line:
        use Date::Manip;


You can also create the man page using the command:
        pod2man Manip.pm > Date::Manip.3
and install it somewhere in your MANPATH.  I have it in:
        /usr/local/man/man3/Date::Manip.3


Once it is installed, you can run the "runtests" command in the "t"
directory to make sure everything works.


TESTS

If any of the tests fail... don't panic.  This is the first release with a
test suite, and the tests themselves may have bugs in them.  Some of them
may run correctly only in the EST timezone for example.  Some will fail if
they are run on a very slow computer (it will compare two different times
that were supposed to be the same but aren't because a measurable amount of
time passed between determining the time in two different ways).  I will
try to get any bugs out of the test suite quickly.
